# BeamMP-Infected-ToW

This is a fork of the original BeamMP-Outbreak project. This has quite a few quality-of-life improvements, ranging from spelling corrections to variable naming improvements, to enabling code that was unused in the original release. It also makes use of the chat box to inform players about critical things like rules during gameplay.

Like the original, this is not complete. I have decided to release my version to help others who are interested in seeing small but meaningful changes.

This is my first attempt at poking around in Lua, and Github. The TODO list is what I may be working on to further the project; no promises. A solid three weeks of coding, testing, and troubleshooting is taking its toll on me, but currently it all works.

Original README below.

# BeamMP-Outbreak

This is a recreation of the Outbreak/Infection mode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

How to use,
  go to the release page and download the latest version, then unpack the zip into the server recourses and it should be good to go,
  then type /outbreak help in chat to get a list of all the commands, then finally to start a game you type /outbreak start.

Thanks to Stefan750 for some help with colors and screen tint and Saile for help with the weighted randomizer
Also thanks to the Neilogical/Camodo crew aswell as the Failrace crew for feedback and testing.

Some notes
  this build may not be very suitable for public servers yet as it is very easy to cheat, but it's good for private servers where you might have some personalised rules haha

  Also feel free to use this mod as reference if you want to make your own game modes, it's not the best documented and there's probably some wacky code haha, but maybe it's helpful for some
